# Pale Moon Barebones Tab Groups
An in-progress replacement for Pale Moon's Tab Groups addon.

This is my first time really using JavaScript, so there's a chance that I
do some things in a bad way.

Reason for even doing this?  The existing Tab Groups plugin appears to no
longer work for v28 of Pale Moon.  That, and I've honestly thought for a
while that just having a menu for the tab groups would be enough... in
addition to being easier to code.
